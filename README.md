# PDF to Text Converter

## Description

This is a simple GUI application built with KivyMD that allows users to convert PDF files to text. The application provides an intuitive interface for selecting a PDF file and converting its contents to a text file.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- File selection using a built-in file manager
- Conversion of PDF files to text
- Error handling for invalid file selections and conversion issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Anaconda (for environment management)
- KivyMD
- PyPDF2

## Environment Setup

We use Conda to manage the project environment. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Make sure you have Conda installed. If not, download and install it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-to-text-converter.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

cd pdf-to-text-converter

4. Create the Conda environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml

5. Activate the environment:

conda activate pdf_converter_env

## Installation

Once you have set up and activated the Conda environment, you don't need to install the packages separately as they are already included in the environment.

## Usage

1. Ensure your Conda environment is activated:

conda activate pdf_converter_env

2. Run the application:

python main.py

3. Use the "Select PDF" button to choose a PDF file from your system.

4. Click the "Convert to Text" button to convert the selected PDF to text.

5. The application will display a success message with the path of the output text file, or an error message if something goes wrong.

## How it works

1. The application uses KivyMD for the graphical user interface.
2. File selection is handled by the MDFileManager component.
3. PDF conversion is done using the PyPDF2 library.
4. The converted text is saved in a new file with the same name as the input PDF, but with a .txt extension.
